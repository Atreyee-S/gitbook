### 1. How do I create a new wallet?

To create a new wallet, create a new account with us or login to your existing account and then click on â€˜Create New Walletâ€™. This will create a new wallet and generate a 12 word pass-phrase. Make sure you back up the Passphrase securely. Do not share it with anyone.

To associate a wallet with your Play account, log in to your account and click â€˜Add an existing wallet.â€™ Once you provide the Passphrase or private key, the wallet will appear in the app.

### 3. How do I recover my wallet?

To recover, you need the Passphrase provided when you first created your wallet. If you lose your Passphrase, the wallet will be impossible to recover, because you are the only one that holds the private key! So make sure to back up your Passphrase.
