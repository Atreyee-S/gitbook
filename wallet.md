### 1. How do I create a new wallet?

To create a new wallet, create a new account with us or login to your existing account and then click on â€˜Create New Walletâ€™. This will create a new wallet and generate a 12 word pass-phrase. Make sure you back up the Passphrase securely. Do not share it with anyone.

### 2. How do I add an existing wallet?

To associate a wallet with your Play account, log in to your account and click â€˜Add an existing wallet.â€™ Once you provide the Passphrase or private key, the wallet will appear in the app.

### 3. How do I recover my wallet?

To recover, you need the Passphrase provided when you first created your wallet. If you lose your Passphrase, the wallet will be impossible to recover, because you are the only one that holds the private key! So make sure to back up your Passphrase.

### 4. How is my wallet safe from hacking/exploits?

The Sperax Play team doesnâ€™t store any credentials. As long as you safeguard your Passphrase, the wallet is safe from any external attack.

### 5. Why is my cryptocurrency contract address recognized as invalid in an address bar?

If the contract address shows an invalid error, then the contract address is not an erc-20 token or other supported network based token. Sperax Play currently only supports ERC-20 Ethereum tokens.
